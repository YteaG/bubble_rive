This is a demo of rive with flutter. I have a strong base for motion design with figma, after effects and of course rive which is the best tool for creating interactive apps for mobile and web applications. The app that I provided here is just a demonstration which I got from media while I was looking into rive. I possess animation skills, know how to key frame, adjust the motions accordingly(for example being aware of gravity), anticipations, and character development and reaction.
